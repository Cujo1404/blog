                  <li>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.<br>

                    - Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed 
                    up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action 
                    you took.<br>
                    In my first year at Yoobee, I was 20 years old, one of the last projects was a group project. 
                    No one else in my team put their hands up to be the leader, so I did. A week into this 3-4 week 
                    project I realised my mental health was deteriorating and I wasn't able to handle the workload 
                    required of me. I wasn't being a good leader. At that point I explained my situation to my tutor 
                    and discussed who else in my team may be the best fit, this took a lot for me to admit I was 
                    struggling, I don't usually talk about these kinds of things. We decided on someone and they 
                    were gracefully open to taking on the leadership role. The rest of the project went so smoothly, 
                    and the end product was better than anyone expected. But I can't stop thinking about how much of 
                    my pride I had to swallow that day, to admit I wasn't a good fit, to admit I was wrong, to admit 
                    that I knew someone could do the job way better than I could. It was a true moment of self-realisation.<br><br>


                    - Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.<br>
                    My 'culture' has been limited or stunted. On the outside, I'm a straight white male who grew up on a 
                    farm. On the inside, I carry blood from NZ European and MƒÅori but I have neither of those 
                    traditional teachings in my background. The farm was isolated, my mother passed away when I 
                    was 5, I didn't have many friends, and no internet (yes thats right! No internet, weird right?). For me all 
                    I know is nature. Everything else has been a shock since I left home after 17 years, this world 
                    is corrupted man. I respect nature because that's what I've been most exposed to. But I am open & 
                    respectful in regards to learning more about other cultures.
                  
                  </li><br>
                  <li>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.<br>

                  - Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development<br>
                  My personality is INFP-T. This means I'm the mediator. my friends can see these traits too, 
                  so when I asked them what they thought my strongest values are they replied with similar 
                  characteristics: Kind, intuitive, creative, big picture thinker, sustainable and future-oriented.<br>
                  I guess these things can help me move forward but I also struggle to find the motivation 
                  to keep going each day. I'm sure we all have good days and bad days but whenever I think 
                  of something good my mind has to put a pin in it. My decision making is strongly limited 
                  by my ethical considerations and I think this may hold me back a little.<br><br>
                  
                  - Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect 
                  with learning obstacles.<br>
                  Big picture thinking and patience are two of the biggest I can see that will help me with my learning 
                  journey. but also my kindness will help me make friends.<br><br>

                  - Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but 
                  there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, 
                  and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.<br>
                  2021, the Yoobee Prelude graduation project, also a group project. We crafted a team of 
                  individuals with whom we're technically capable but still worked well in a team. some of us were 
                  more design-focused, others code-focused. 3 of us worked on the design, 2 more joined a couple of 
                  days later when that part was over. I felt there was quite a lot of push back between designers 
                  and developers, each of us wanted the website built 'our way'. there was one particular moment 
                  where we just couldn't decide on a way to display the student portfolio. I mediated a discussion 
                  on the outcomes of each option, let each person share why they think it's best, in the end, I was 
                  able to suggest an option that satisfied both people and we went on our merry way. looking back I 
                  feel that was a defining moment where I used my 'big picture thinking', it felt good to settle what 
                  could have been a big argument.
