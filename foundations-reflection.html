                    What surprised me the most about learning core is how deep they go to make sure a person is good. 
                    learning about growth mindset was interesting. i forgot to set a timer, brb.defining my identity, 
                    values and strengths was really beneficial. learning the level of EQ vs IQ and the difference 
                    between them is life changing. more people should be aware of this concept, its great when we 
                    have more emotionally intelligent people in the world as there would be way less bullies and 
                    such. neuroplasticity is great concept too, to know the brain has the capability to be forever 
                    moulding to the situation at hand give hope for those that say the words “I can’t”
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    * What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?<br>
                    ego death for the win! without communicating that i still have an inflated sense of self importance i 
                    believe i have a great understand of emotional intelligence considering the shit ive seen and dealt 
                    with in my early life. 
                    neuroplastity extends on from the concept of growth mindset, but it is very interesting to me. i used 
                    to take brain training exercises and they would show me a map of what my brain looks like including 
                    strentghts and weaknesses. this was a static image and it never communicated that i had the 
                    opportunity to grow and mould forever. also, everyone says that we stop growing at 25, but is 
                    that really true?
                    Journalling is great and should be encouraged more often. yoga and mindfulness too!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    * What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?<br>
                    values, empathy and self awareness in a person make them a good team player. it helps everyone 
                    communicate freely either without or just aware of their bias and privilege.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    * What has surprised you the most about the core learning?<br>
                    I feel like you’re expecting me to say it was life changing or dramatical made me question myself. 
                    I have already questioned myself far too much, i overthink a lot already and dont see myself as a 
                    terrible person. but i guess the reading was require so we developers are all on the same page.
                      
                </li>
                <li>
                    * Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core 
                    learning in a web development bootcamp course?<br>
                    because schooling should be about quality, not quantity. y’all have the right idea, and i will 
                    forever recommend this place over “other” schools ive been to. Y’all want to make sure your 
                    people are good at heart, so when the industry looks back and sees good people coming from one 
                    place they’ll wants to support your further. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    * Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have 
                    just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.<br>
                    defiantly not, as said previously EQ is more valuable than IQ. someone can be the greatest 
                    programmer but they’re unlikely to be a very good team player. 
                    For me the importance of emotional intelligence in others draws back to the cause of my social 
                    anxiety, i don’t wanna talk to someone who will constantly critique and judge me, i need someone 
                    understand of my own personal situation. so i get it, we all need to be better humans first.
